LUG Bylaws
==========

Preamble
--------
This is a set of bylaws for the Oregon State University Linux Users Group. These
are not set in stone and are in fact meant to be dynamic; adapting to the needs
of the community as they change. These bylaws are seperate from our constitution
(which is also in this repository) but ought to be enforced by the OSU Linux
Users Group community.

For information on contributing to the set of bylaws see the `Contributing`
section below.

Bylaws
-----
* There should be a maximum of one bot in the irc channel (#osu-lug,
  irc.freenode.net) at any time.
* Any malicious (i.e., 'black hat') material shared in the official
  OSU LUG IRC Channels should be presented in an academic or educational
  context. We do not encourage the use of malicious exploits under any
  circumstances.
