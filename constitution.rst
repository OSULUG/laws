If an officer or a member has failed to carry out their responsibilites has violated
this constitution in the view of other officers or members, general discipline may be applied. A vote
for general discipline may be called for by two student members or one officer. If the vote
has been initiated, a quorum of officers must also agree on the discipline for it to
move forward. The terms of the discipline may be defined by all parties participating in the
discussion and must be fully accepted by defending member. If an agreement is not reached, the
issue may be elevated to a vote of no confidence if desired. Note that the Vote of No Confidence

Vote of No Confidence (2)
-------------------------

A vote of no confidence may be called by any Student Member during any meeting, which
must be seconded by another present member to question the eligibility or qualifications 
of an officer or member of a standing committee. If a vote is to take place, then the member
calling for the vote must provide written or verbal reasoning within 24 hours. In following, the
officer in question has one week to provide either written or verbal defense of their
title if they so choose. Once either a week has passed or official defense has been
provided, a vote of no confidence shall be conducted by the secretary. If the officer
conducting the vote of no confidence has a conflict of interest, then the highest ranking
officer without a conflict of interest shall conduct the vote of no confidence, in a manner
that allows for secret ballots. Voting shall take place for a minimum of one week, with
results to be announced at the next meeting following the end of the voting period. A vote 
of no confidence requires a majority of a quorum of voting members. In the case the vote is
successful, the officer will be immediately removed from office, and the office will be 
considered vacant.
